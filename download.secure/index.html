		<h1>todaystime software download</h1>
		<p>First, download xampp<a href="https://apachefriends.org"> here</a></p>
		<p>Install to C:\todaystime-webserver\xampp</p>
		<p>Copy and paste your HTML documents to xampp\htdocs, removing the existing files beforehand</p>
		<p>Open xampp-control.exe and start Apache (and MySQL for phpmyadmin)</p>
		<p>Your website will be hosted at http://localhost/yourhtmldoc.html</p>
		<p>If you have a folder in htdocs, like htdocs\subsite with index.html in it, you can go to http://localhost/subsite without "index.html"</p>
		<p>Folders containg index.html will automatically use index.html when visiting the folder with localhost.</p>
		<p>For help, stylesheets, open-source code, security guarantees, etc. visit todaystime or see the next section</p>
		<p>Starting MySQL will allow you to go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin</p>
		<h2>Setting up todaystime on localhost<h2>
		<p>Download all todaystime HTML files and add them to the root directory of htdocs</p>
		<p>Make a new folder in the root directory of htdocs with the name of your site and cut and paste your HTML docs into that folder</p>
		<p>Then todaystime will be setup at localhost, so you can access your website and get help through todaystime</p>
		<p>This is optional, but is reccommended if you would like help</p>
